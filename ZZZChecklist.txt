Experiment with bottom navbar, decide whether to use MUI or not. Probably not. ðŸ˜†

BIG REFACTOR: Create bottom navigation that contains link to "Current", "Map", and "Forecast"; 
check out MUI's bottom nav component. (To be displayed on all pages.)

Consider using MUI's select component for style and layer dropdowns

Move search form into its own component and render at top of screen so it is showing
on all pages, a bit like a navbar

Learn how to use React Router or set up a routing system in order to create a CurrentPage, 
a MapPage and a ForecastPage, or use SPA techniques and render content conditionally according
to user selection [see next]

Have a panel display barebones weather data for current location next to map marker on map view?
Barebones = temp, description, an icon

Make UI more attractive on CurrentWeather view/page, add more stats/icons?

Get Vercel environment variables working

Display arrow icons corresponding to wind direction

Decide whether to have a default custom layer displayed on app start or not.
This will affect whether we need an if (prevLayer) or an if (layer) conditional in main useEffect
hook (one with layer and mapObj dependencies).
