********************************************************************** BETA VERSION

Fix CurrentPage running hooks conditionally:
    - Rewrite convertWeatherData to be robust / defensive so that it can handle both data being
    null and data points not containing certain values, e.g. gust.
    - Rewrite useGetBackground to receive a data argument passed down from the page level and make
    sure it is robust / defensive

Implement new charts/visuals for displaying current weather stats

Make sure search suggestions don't fall underneath timestamps row of forecast table

Implement debouncer for search suggestions

Make location name, icon, and description go underneath search bar but above header on forecast page

FIX map.jsx, it's a mess and shouldn't need to use userRenderCount!

Forecast page:
        - Make ForecastTable component and refactor into smaller subcomponents
        - Move forecast table into modal and add link for "See full data table" to forecast page
        - On main forecast page build easier-to-read "outlook" / "summary" dashboards
        - Next to each heading on forecast table have a "See graph" link that displays
          line charts using Chart.js. Enable side-scrolling similar to T.io app
        
Store user map zoom and tilt in state so that navigating back to map page takes user
to exactly where they left off

Somehow cache map and map layer data so they don't need to be re-rendered every time User 
goes to map page

Figure how to display error page if there is a fetchCurrentWeather error

Represent temp as a bar graphic similar to met office website on forecast table?

Fix (i) and mapbox icons on map being blocked out on smaller screens

Add a units selection option?: imperial or metric

Use Vercel environment variables

Turn layers dropdown into a modal displaying key/scale image
