# Live Weather Map

## Deployed: https://weather-app-lime-beta.vercel.app

## Brief Overview

A front-end weather app created in React + JS that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap and Mapbox APIs to display current and forecasted weather data together with an integrated map. The map supports multiple raster-based datasets for displaying realtime weather patterns, with forecast data yet to be implemented with an adjustable slider for projecting forwards or backwards in time. The plan is to continue adding useful statistics and improve the current weather UI to be slick and visually appealing, and completely overhaul the forecast page UI with a plethora of informative charts and visualizations.
